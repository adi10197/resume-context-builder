## Position
**Software Development Engineer (L5)** at **Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Cognito Lumen Team**
*January 2024 - December 2024*

## Responsibilities
- Architected and implemented pricing entitlement framework for Cognito User Pools
- Led integration testing, bug bash, and security reviews for pricing enhancements
- Enabled 20KB custom attribute values for enterprise customers (Wiz) during major data store migration
- Optimized CI/CD pipeline deployment processes reducing blockage time by 320-850%
- Resolved critical metering incident post-mortem affecting customer billing accuracy
- Implemented autoscaling improvements for DDoS resilience
- Established team learning programs and mentored 4 engineers
- Led FedRAMP compliance initiative (TLSv1.3 enablement)

## Major Achievements and Impact
- **Pricing Entitlement Framework**: Zero bugs in production rollout, zero additional latency introduced across all user pool management APIs (create, update, MFA configuration, log delivery, domain management), implemented build-time guard rails preventing runtime type-casting errors, designed robust interceptor with hard-typed parameters preventing developer errors
- **20KB Custom Attribute Values**: Enabled enterprise customer (Wiz) migration, increased internal data store availability to support 1000 TPS of 100KB user objects, added hard security checks limiting user objects to 100KB, successfully navigated complex multi-system dependencies (internal data store, control plane APIs, data plane APIs) during major data store migration project
- **CI/CD Pipeline Deployment Optimization**: Reduced service code pipeline blockage by 320% (52 hours to 16.15 hours), reduced infrastructure pipeline blockage by 850% (78 hours to 9.18 hours), created extensible solution for all Cognito User Pools teams, eliminated mixed deployment order issues causing load balancer 5XX errors
- **Metering Incident Post-Mortem Resolution**: Recovered 8.34% Monthly Active Users (MAU) billing deficit ($XXM impact), upgraded metering subsystem to v4.0 with improved metrics and alarms, implemented reconciliation mechanisms with AWS Account/Payer ID by SKU, created standardized peak planning template preventing future throttling
- **Integration Testing Coverage**: Achieved 100% test coverage for new pricing functionality and regression scenarios, fixed all default behavior changes across OAuth/user pool management/user authentication test suites, resolved synthetic monitoring issues with external SDK limitations
- **Autoscaling Improvements**: Implemented request-count-based scaling responding to traffic spikes earlier, maintained static stability while improving response time, disabled scale-in for peak readiness
- **Team Development**: Established AWS Cognito Gateway New Hire Orientation program, launched monthly AWS Cognito Learning Sessions, created broadcast playlist for knowledge sharing, mentored 4 engineers

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Java, Python, TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Spring, web service framework, JUnit, Infrastructure as Code (CDK), serverless testing framework
- **Databases**: DynamoDB, distributed data store, internal identity data store
- **Cloud/DevOps**: AWS (EC2, Application Load Balancer, Auto Scaling Groups, CloudWatch, EventBridge, Lambda, S3, SNS, DynamoDB), Infrastructure as Code (CDK), monitoring/alerting platform, CI/CD pipelines
- **Security**: Security compliance, security review system, TLS 1.3, FedRAMP compliance
- **Testing**: Integration testing, load testing, bug bash, synthetic monitoring
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, data lake logging system, metrics, business metrics, anomaly detection
- **Tools**: Git, IntelliJ, build system, usage metering client

## Professional Development
- Led security reviews and threat modeling for pricing enhancements
- Drove first Cognito User Pools Operational Readiness Review completion since 2022 with Principal Engineer sign-off
- Attended Metering Summit 2024 and groomed best practices
- Developed expertise in entitlement frameworks and pricing systems
- Strengthened skills in multi-system integration during major data store migration (internal data store, control plane APIs, data plane APIs)
- Gained deep knowledge of metering systems and billing reconciliation
- Primary mentor for 2 engineers
