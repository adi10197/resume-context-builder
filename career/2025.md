# 2025 Career Summary

## Position
**Software Development Engineer (L5)** at **Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Cognito Lumen Team**
*January 2025 - Present*

## Responsibilities
- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity (0-to-1 Launch)**: Led development and general availability launch of OAuth as a Service platform for Amazon Bedrock, including:
  - Architected and deployed Authorizer SDK with multi-tenant caching for 3rd party access token validation
  - Designed Fine Grained Access Control (FGAC) for custom JWT claims authorization
  - Led OneBox environment deployment with zero downtime migration to GA
  - Implemented comprehensive monitoring framework (high/medium severity incident tracking, customer support escalation automation, executive leadership dashboards)
  - Identified and resolved critical OAuth security vulnerabilities (Universal Redirect URI, Authorization URL Session Binding) in production service
- Implemented Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) metering with async polling thread pool architecture
- Optimized infrastructure costs through scale-in analysis (55.7% EC2 capacity reduction potential)
- Established Cognito-specific Amazon Q RAG model for developer productivity
- Resolved long-standing audit log compliance issues with Security and Legal leadership

## Major Achievements and Impact
- **Authorizer SDK (Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity)**: Achieved low latency through security-approved multi-tenant multi-layer caching, eliminated external discovery endpoint dependencies through new internal service API, supported non-standard OIDC providers (Github) with custom discovery endpoints, enabled multiple enterprise customers (Netflix, Intuit, Cohere Health)
- **Fine Grained Access Control - FGAC (Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity)**: Extended authorization beyond standard OAuth claims (aud/client_id/sub) to custom JWT claims, designed maximum configurability for future policy engine support, coordinated design changes across UX, Gateway, and Runtime teams
- **OneBox Environment Deployment (Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity)**: Resolved circular dependencies in infrastructure (load balancers, services, VPC endpoints), debugged log configuration failures without existing logs/metrics, retroactively added OneBox metrics to all alarms in separate namespace, achieved zero downtime migration for GA
- **End-to-End Monitoring (Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity)**: Implemented comprehensive monitoring (high/medium severity alarms, pre-deployment validation, customer support escalation automation, synthetic transaction monitoring, anomaly detection, rollback monitors), onboarded to executive leadership monitoring platform, created Region Build Automation-compliant service dashboards and management dashboards, determined relevant metrics and thresholds for complete service
- **OAuth as a Service Security Vulnerability Resolution (Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity)**: Identified and resolved 2 critical security vulnerabilities in production OAuth service affecting authentication flows for enterprise customers. **Universal Redirect URI Vulnerability**: Prevented open redirect attacks where malicious actors could hijack OAuth authorization codes by exploiting wildcard redirect URI validation, implementing strict URI matching and validation. **Authorization URL Session Binding**: Fixed session fixation vulnerability where authorization requests lacked proper state parameter validation, enabling CSRF attacks. Collaborated with security engineering team to replicate attack vectors, implement fixes, and validate remediation across all authentication flows
- **MRR Metering Implementation**: Identified stateless Lambda + metering client design flaw (lost events due to shutdown hooks), evaluated alternatives (event collection service vs async polling), implemented async polling thread pool in Cognito User Pools instances preventing event loss
- **Automatic Target Weights (ATW)**: Implemented automatic detection and weight-away from hosts with intermittent HTTP 500s, performed load tests with fault injection, identified and fixed edge case where OneBox rollback monitors wouldn't trigger properly
- **Audit Log Compliance Resolution**: Resolved long-standing high-severity incidents from 2023 (missing/incorrect audit events), reengaged audit logging and security operations teams, created messaging for security and legal leadership, deployed fix preventing future concurrent deployment alarms
- **Availability Monitoring Scripts**: Built multi-threaded month-on-month availability calculator at load balancer level based on Cognito public SLA, automated documentation updates with proper permissions, included month-to-date metrics for operators
- **Scale-In Analysis**: Discovered 55.7% over-scaling in IAD/CMH/LHR regions (5% CPU utilization vs safe 20-25%), identified cost overhead and increased latency from cache misses, laid out plan maintaining static stability
- **Customer Support Escalation Updates**: Added 10-minute <99.9% availability trigger criteria for lower-impact long-duration events, improved automatic customer notification mechanism
- **Build-Time Validation**: Used AI CLI to generate validation unit tests for rate limits configuration, prevented high-severity incidents from operator errors during ingestion/activation, stopped billing issues from unaddressed incidents
- **Cognito Q Model**: Trained Cognito-specific RAG model for Amazon Q inline suggestions in IntelliJ, improved developer productivity with context-aware code completion
- **Learning Sessions**: Established Cognito Lumen learning sessions educating new hires and tenured members on higher rates, metering, architecture, created broadcast playlist for knowledge sharing

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Java, Python, TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Spring, OAuth Authorizer SDK, Policy Engine (Cedar), Amazon Q RAG
- **Databases**: DynamoDB, distributed data store
- **Cloud/DevOps**: AWS (Lambda, Application Load Balancer, Auto Scaling Groups, EC2, CloudWatch, EventBridge, SNS, SQS, VPC Endpoints), Infrastructure as Code (CDK), OneBox, monitoring/alerting platform
- **Security**: Security compliance, OIDC, JWT, OAuth 2.0, Custom Claims, Fine-Grained Access Control, audit logging, security operations
- **Monitoring**: Executive leadership monitoring platform, high/medium severity alarms, customer support escalation automation, synthetic monitoring, anomaly detection, Region Build Automation dashboards
- **Metering**: Usage metering clients, event collection services, async polling architecture

- **Tools**: Git, IntelliJ, build system, CI/CD pipelines, AI CLI, multi-threading

## Professional Development
- Led complex OAuth security vulnerability investigations with cross-team collaboration
- Developed expertise in OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and JWT authorization patterns for enterprise-scale services
- Gained deep knowledge of multi-tenant caching strategies and security compliance
- Strengthened skills in zero-downtime migrations and circular dependency resolution
- Mastered comprehensive monitoring frameworks and SLA-based availability calculations
- Applied AI/ML to developer productivity through custom model training
