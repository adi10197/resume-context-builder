# 2023 Career Summary

## Position
**Software Development Engineer (L5)** at **Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Cognito Lumen Team**
*January 2023 - December 2023*

## Responsibilities
- Led migration of testing infrastructure from Test on Demand to serverless testing framework
- Designed and implemented security enhancements for symmetric key management
- Drove TLS 1.2+ enforcement across all Cognito User Pools endpoints for FedRAMP compliance
- Prevented concurrent deployment issues causing data loss and availability drops
- Conducted load testing and CPU profiling to identify performance bottlenecks
- Led peak planning initiatives for high-traffic periods
- Mentored team members on Cognito architecture and best practices

## Major Achievements and Impact
- **Region Build Automation Migration to Serverless Testing**: Reduced test execution time by 5x (from 20 minutes to 4 minutes), eliminated Test on Demand worker fleet management overhead, enabled automated load testing with Fargate serverless architecture
- **Symmetric Key Migration from Legacy System**: Automated secret generation and distribution for new regions (CPT, CGK), eliminated manual pipeline template synthesis and S3 uploads, passed security and AWS Cryptography reviews
- **TLS 1.2+ Enforcement**: Successfully enforced security compliance framework with zero customer escalations through phased rollout (soft enforcement with feature flags, then hard enforcement at load balancer level)
- **Concurrent Deployment Prevention**: Eliminated 100% of high-severity incidents from concurrent deployments (previously 3+ incidents), prevented CloudWatch log data loss, implemented 10-min bake time and monitoring platform alerts as pipeline blockers
- **DDoS Incident Post-Mortem Action Items**: Identified CPU bottlenecks through load testing and profiling, updated Auto Scaling Groups scale-up threshold from conflicting policies to single 50% CPU threshold with 100% capacity increase
- **Peak Planning 2024**: Successfully prepared Cognito User Pools for peak traffic by manually scaling fleet to maximum capacity, preventing availability drops during high-traffic periods
- **Deployment Safety Questionnaire**: Identified and documented deployment safety risks across software development, monitoring, and change release processes, generated Operational Readiness Review action items with criticality ratings

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Java, Python, TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Spring, serverless testing framework, Infrastructure as Code (CDK)
- **Databases**: DynamoDB, S3
- **Cloud/DevOps**: AWS (Lambda, Fargate, Application Load Balancer, Auto Scaling Groups, CloudWatch, KMS, Secrets Manager), Infrastructure as Code (CDK), monitoring/alerting platform
- **Security**: Security compliance, TLS 1.2+, symmetric key cryptography, FedRAMP compliance
- **Testing**: Serverless testing framework, Test on Demand, load testing, CPU profiling
- **Tools**: Git, CI/CD pipelines, legacy secrets management system, pipeline template framework

## Professional Development
- Led security and AWS Cryptography security reviews
- Developed expertise in serverless testing frameworks and infrastructure automation
- Gained deep knowledge of TLS protocols and FedRAMP compliance requirements
- Strengthened skills in load testing, performance profiling, and capacity planning
- Mentored team member on Cognito systems
