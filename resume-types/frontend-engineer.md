### Emphasis Areas
1. **UI/UX Implementation** - Translating designs into polished interfaces
2. **Component Architecture** - Building reusable, maintainable component systems
3. **Performance** - Web vitals, bundle optimization, rendering performance
4. **Cross-browser/Device** - Responsive design, accessibility, compatibility
5. **Developer Experience** - Build tools, testing, design systems

### Section Order
1. Header (Name and Contact Info)
2. Technical Skills (grouped by category)
3. Professional Experience
4. Education
5. Projects (optional - for impressive UI/open source work)
6. Certifications (optional)

## Technical Skills Section Format

Group skills into frontend-relevant categories:
```markdown
## Technical Skills

**Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS
**Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Vue.js, Angular
**State Management**: Redux, Zustand, React Query, Pinia
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, CSS Modules, Material UI
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, Playwright
**Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, ESBuild, Babel
**Tools**: Git, Figma, Storybook, Chrome DevTools
```

## Experience Bullet Point Guidelines

### Prioritize
- UI/UX implementation and design collaboration
- Component library and design system contributions
- Performance optimizations (Core Web Vitals, bundle size, rendering)
- Accessibility improvements (WCAG compliance)
- Cross-browser compatibility solutions
- State management architecture
- Testing strategies for UI components
- Developer tooling and build optimization

### De-emphasize
- Backend work (unless full-stack role)
- DevOps and infrastructure
- Database design
- Pure algorithmic work

### Example Bullet Points
- Built component library with 50+ reusable React components, adopted by 4 product teams and reducing development time by 35%
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores from 45 to 92 through code splitting, image optimization, and render blocking elimination
- Implemented design system in Storybook with comprehensive documentation, enabling designers and developers to collaborate effectively
- Reduced bundle size by 60% through tree shaking, lazy loading, and dependency optimization using Webpack 5
- Achieved WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across 30+ pages, improving accessibility score from 67 to 98
- Built real-time collaborative editing feature using WebSockets and optimistic UI updates, serving 10K+ concurrent users

## Technologies Section per Role

For each position, include frontend-specific tech stack:
```markdown
**Technologies**: React, TypeScript, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Jest, Webpack
```

## Projects Section (Optional)

Include if:
- Open source UI libraries or contributions
- Notable design system work
- Impressive personal portfolio pieces
- Side projects demonstrating frontend expertise

Format:
```markdown
## Projects

**Component Library Name** | [GitHub Link] | [Demo Link]
Reusable React component library with 500+ GitHub stars
- Built with TypeScript, comprehensive test coverage, and Storybook documentation
```

## Job Description Tailoring

When job description is provided:
- Match framework and library requirements (React vs Vue vs Angular)
- Emphasize relevant styling approaches (CSS-in-JS vs utility-first)
- Highlight experience with mentioned design tools (Figma, Sketch)
- Feature performance work if performance-focused role
- Emphasize accessibility if mentioned in requirements
- Match state management experience to job requirements

## What to Minimize
- Backend and infrastructure work
- Data engineering or ML work
- Management responsibilities (unless relevant)
- Outdated technologies (jQuery, unless specifically required)

## Portfolio Considerations

If applying to roles that value portfolios:
- Include link to portfolio site in contact info
- Reference specific portfolio pieces in project section
- Mention design collaboration and visual implementation skills
