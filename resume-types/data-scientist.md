## Experience Bullet Point Guidelines

### Prioritize
- Model development and deployment
- Business impact and metrics improvement
- Experimentation and A/B testing
- Feature engineering and data pipeline work
- Cross-functional collaboration with product/engineering
- Production ML systems
- Novel approaches or research contributions

### De-emphasize
- Pure software engineering work (unless ML-related)
- Data entry or basic reporting
- Non-technical project coordination
- Infrastructure work (unless MLOps focused)

### Example Bullet Points
- Developed recommendation system using collaborative filtering and deep learning, increasing user engagement by 25% and driving $10M incremental revenue
- Built fraud detection model using XGBoost and feature engineering, reducing fraudulent transactions by 40% while maintaining 99.5% precision
- Designed and analyzed 50+ A/B experiments, providing statistical rigor that influenced $50M+ in product decisions
- Implemented real-time ML inference pipeline serving 1M+ predictions/day with <50ms latency using AWS SageMaker
- Created NLP classification model using BERT fine-tuning, automating ticket routing and reducing manual triage time by 60%
- Built end-to-end ML pipeline from data ingestion to model monitoring, reducing model deployment time from weeks to days

## Education Section

Education is particularly important for data science roles:
```markdown
## Education

**M.S. Computer Science** - Stanford University (2020)
Specialization: Machine Learning
Relevant Coursework: Deep Learning, Statistical Learning, NLP, Computer Vision

**B.S. Mathematics** - UC Berkeley (2018)
Minor: Statistics
```

## Publications/Research Section (Optional)

Include if you have relevant publications:
```markdown
## Publications

- "Efficient Transformer Models for Production NLP" - NeurIPS 2023 Workshop
- "Scalable Recommendation Systems at Company" - RecSys 2022
```

## Technologies Section per Role

For each position, include ML-specific tech stack:
```markdown
**Technologies**: Python, PyTorch, SQL, Spark, AWS SageMaker, A/B Testing
```

## Job Description Tailoring

When job description is provided:
- Match ML domain (NLP, Computer Vision, RecSys, etc.)
- Emphasize relevant frameworks (PyTorch vs TensorFlow)
- Highlight experience with mentioned cloud platforms
- Feature experimentation experience if data-driven company
- Match industry domain if specified (fintech, healthcare, etc.)
- Emphasize production ML if engineering-heavy role

## What to Minimize
- Basic data analysis or reporting (focus on ML)
- Pure software engineering (unless relevant)
- Outdated tools and techniques
- Academic projects (unless highly relevant or recent grad)

## Projects Section

Include if:
- Kaggle competitions with notable rankings
- Open source ML contributions
- Research projects with real-world applications
- Side projects demonstrating ML expertise

Format:
```markdown
## Projects
